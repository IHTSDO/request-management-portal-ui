This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --configuration=en` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
